# Work Habits during Release 3

## Introduction

This document is meant to be a overview of how our work habits have been for release 3. We will go through how we have worked and reflect over what we are pleased with and what we wish we had executed better.

## Work Habits we are not pleased with

Below we go through the work habits we were not pleased with.

### Utilising Issues as Branches

Something we wished we had done better is utilising issues as branches. Halfway through the development of release 3 we found out that gitlab lets us create branches based on issues. This is something we have somewhat utilised during development, but not something we have utilised to the degree we would have liked to.

### Branches/Issues becoming bigger than intended

When we faced issues where wanted to implement certain features, the branches ended up becoming far bigger and more intricate than initally anticipated. In these cases there is no clear overview. We had a few of these situations and should we have done it again we absolutely would have broken things down into smaller issues.

## Work Habits we are pleased with

Below we go through the work habits we were pleased with:

### Weekly Work Sessions

We continued using weekly meetings the same as in release 2. Where we would have semi-weekly work sessions. We are very pleased with this solutions. We found the sessions to be productive and efficient.

### Structure of Work Sessions

The work sessions had very clear structures.
These work sessions began with a meeting where we would go through what we had done since the last sessions, what we wanted to achieve for the work session and we eventually discussed any issues/design choices. The structure vaguely resembling scrum meetings. After this meeting we would split the work needed to be done, first by creating issues in gitlab and then using git branches where we would try to solve the gitlab issues. We found this structure to be efficient getting the work started fast, and it allowed us to clear up issues beforehand.

### Pair Programming

We were also very pleased with our use of pair programming during release 3. With the implementation of both API/Server and Web application it was very simple for the group to split the work halfways between two pairs. Therefore we ended up with one pair cooperating on API/Server while the other pair cooperating on web application. We naturally did review code across the pairs. Being two people solving the same problems made the actual problem solving very efficient. The structure also made sure that there where two people who had great control over the two new implementations.

### Merge Requests

We are happy with the way we continued using merge requests from release 2. We aspired to make the merge requests and commit messages clear and precise. We are also happy with the fact we utilised squash commits. We found reviewing previous commits to be easy and clear.
