# CORE module

This module contains the central classes used in our application. The module is contains three classes and the [json](src/main/java/core/json). The Drink and ingredient classes are data oriented classes and the MixMaven class is used for filehandling, which it achieves by delegating to the relevant utility classes.

The json folder contains a json file and two additional utility classes for writing and reading json.
